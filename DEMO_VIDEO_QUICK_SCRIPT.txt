DEMO VIDEO SCRIPT - 5 MINUTES
==============================

[0:00-0:30] INTRODUCTION
-------------------------
"Hello! Welcome to the Job Board Platform Backend API demo. 
Today I'll show you how this REST API works, demonstrate 
key endpoints, and explain best practices. Let's start!"

[0:30-1:00] API OVERVIEW
-------------------------
"This API is built with Django REST Framework and PostgreSQL.
It supports three roles: admin, employer, and job seeker.
All endpoints are documented with Swagger UI."

[SHOW: Navigate to /api/docs/]

[1:00-2:00] AUTHENTICATION
--------------------------
"Let's start with authentication. I'll register a new user."

[POST /api/auth/register/]
{
  "username": "demo_user",
  "email": "demo@example.com",
  "password": "securepass123",
  "password2": "securepass123",
  "role": "user"
}

"Great! Now let's log in to get JWT tokens."

[POST /api/auth/login/]
{
  "username": "demo_user",
  "password": "securepass123"
}

"We received access and refresh tokens. We'll use the access 
token in the Authorization header for authenticated requests."

[2:00-3:30] JOB MANAGEMENT
--------------------------
"Now let's explore job management. First, list all jobs."

[GET /api/jobs/]

"Now I'll create a new job as an employer."

[POST /api/jobs/ - as employer]
{
  "title": "Senior Python Developer",
  "description": "Looking for experienced developer...",
  "category": "[id]",
  "location": "Remote",
  "job_type": "full-time",
  "salary_min": 80000,
  "salary_max": 120000
}

"Notice the validation - salary_max must be >= salary_min.
Now let's update the job status."

[PATCH /api/jobs/{id}/]
{
  "status": "active"
}

"Let's also demonstrate search with filters."

[GET /api/jobs/?search=python&location=remote]

[3:30-4:30] APPLICATION MANAGEMENT
-----------------------------------
"Now let's see how users apply for jobs."

[POST /api/applications/]
{
  "job": "[job_id]",
  "cover_letter": "I'm excited to apply...",
  "resume": "[file]"
}

"Notice file validation - only PDF/DOC/DOCX up to 5MB.
Let's check the application status."

[GET /api/applications/]

"As an employer, I can update the application status."

[PATCH /api/applications/{id}/]
{
  "status": "reviewed"
}

[4:30-5:30] BEST PRACTICES
--------------------------
"Let me highlight best practices we've implemented:

1. RESTful Design - Proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)

2. JWT Authentication - Stateless, secure token-based auth

3. Role-Based Access Control - Users can only access permitted resources

4. Input Validation - All inputs validated (files, ranges, required fields)

5. Error Handling - Appropriate HTTP status codes and clear messages

6. API Documentation - Swagger UI with interactive testing"

[SHOW: Examples of each]

[5:30-6:00] CONCLUSION
-----------------------
"In summary, this API demonstrates production-ready features:
secure authentication, role-based access, comprehensive CRUD,
advanced search, and thorough documentation. Thank you!"

KEY POINTS TO HIGHLIGHT:
- JWT tokens in action
- Validation working
- Role-based permissions
- Swagger documentation
- Clean error responses
